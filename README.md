# EventPlanner
This Event Planner Web Application is designed to allow users to Create, Read, Update, &amp; Delete events.

# Usage
When first navigatigating to https://eventplanner.azurewebsites.net/, the home page only has clickable links to Register and Login. After completing one of the two, the three headings become clickable as well as a populated navbar.
#### 1. Subjects
The ability to add subjects provides more detail for those who may have many topics they wish to schedule events for, as well as making it simpler to categorize those events.

#### 2. Locations
By adding a location for an event, it allows input for a specific place, the address, & travel time to that place. These locations can also be reused whenever needed for new events. 

#### 3. Events
Finally, once you have a subject and a location, you are ready to schedule an event! There will be dropdowns to choose from for the subjects & locations, as well as other information to include more detail about your event. Once your event is created, it will display in a card with minimal information, but when the details icon is clicked, all of the information for that event is displayed. When more events are added, they will be displayed by date. All events are able to be edited & deleted as well.
